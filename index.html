              <li>Kingside castling places the King away from the center and safer behind a rank of protected Pawns; furthermore it’s a quicker move than Queenside castling since only 2 pieces have to be moved before.</li>

              <li>After most of the pieces, especially Queens, have been traded off, the King takes a predominant role in the battle and becomes an aggressive piece.</li>
              <li>Since the King is a piece of little mobility, it’s recommended to centralize it as quick as possible so that it may move fast to the position on the chessboard where it is most needed.</li>

              <li>Zugzwang is a situation in which any movement the player makes results in an even worse situation than if no move at all was performed (diagram).</li>
              <li>This resource is particularly important in Bishop versus Knight endgames.</li>
              <li>Since the Bishop has control on practically the same squares when it moves on a diagonal, it has a great time advantage on the Knight that loses control on squares when it moves.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Bishops of opposite colors may represent an advantage for the active color in the middle game, since the Bishop of the defensive part won’t be able to neutralize the pressure on a certain diagonal.</li>

              <li>Usually, a Knight has a hard time to fight passed Pawns, due to its little mobility.</li>
              <li>When these Pawns are Rook Pawns, it gets even harder, because Knights have more restricted movements close to the borders.</li>
